# Hiiii, ðŸ‘‹ Adithya here.

I'm a **Software Engineer & AI/ML Enthusiast** with experience in building scalable systems, machine learning models, and AI-driven applications. I recently completed my **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Syracuse University**, and Iâ€™ve worked on projects across **LLMs, NLP, Computer Vision, and performance-aware systems**. I would love to chat all things AI and baking.

### ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™ve Worked On  
- **Research at Syracuse University** â†’ Working on developing personalized adaptive AI agents with **HuggingFace LLMs**, studying cognition in Agentic systems
- **Intel Internship** â†’ ML pipelines to analyze CPU/GPU power-state data with **SoCWatch**, improving performance-per-watt insights.  
- **Healthcare AI** â†’ Melanoma detection system (ResNet50/EfficientNet) on 50,000+ images with **97.6% accuracy**.  
- **NLP Projects** â†’ Reddit Mental Health classification (LSTMs + topic modeling), Movie review sentiment analysis with HuggingFace transformers with diigtal trace data.  

### ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring  
- **Computational Communication**, Cognition in AI 
- Large-scale **LLM applications** (agents, retrieval-augmented generation).  
- **Distributed systems** for ML inference.  
- Optimization of **AI workloads on CPUs/GPUs**.
